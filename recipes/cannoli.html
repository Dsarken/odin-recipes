    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <h2>Shells:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shortening</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sweet Marsala wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 egg white</li>
        <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Filling:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) containr ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped(Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <h3>Step 1 </h3>
    <p>Make shells: Mix flour, sugar, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl.<br>Cut in shortening until crumbly.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Make a well in the center and add Marsala wine, water, vinegar, egg, and<br>egg yolk.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Mix with a fork until the dough becomes stiff, then finish kneading it by<br>hand on a clean surface, adding a
        bit more water if needed for about 10<br>minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Divide cannoli dough into three balls; flatten each one just enough to get<br>through the pasta machine. Roll a
        ball
        of dough through successively thinner<br>settings until you have reached the thinnest setting. Dust lightly with
        flour if<br>necessary.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Place the sheet of dough on a lightly floured surface. Using a cutter or large<br>glass, cut out 4 to 5-inch
        circles.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Dust the circles with a light coating of flour. This will help you later in removing<br>the shells from the
        tubes.
        Roll dough around cannoli tubes, sealing the edge<br>with a bit of egg white. Repeat with remaining dough balls.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>Fry shells on the tubes in hot oil, a few at a time, until golden, about 2 to 3<br>minutes. Use tongs to turn as
        needed. Remove shells carefully using tongs,<br>and place them on a cooling rack set over paper towels.</p>
    <h3>Step 9</h3>
    <p>Cool just long enough that you can handle the<br>tubes, then carefully twist the tube to remove the
        shell.<br>Using
        a
        tea towel may help you get a better grip. Wash<br>or wipe off the tubes, and use them for more shells. Cooled
        shells can be placed<br>in an airtight container and kept for up to 2 months. You should only fill them<br>
        immediately
        or up to 1 hour before serving.</p>
    <h3>Step 10</h3>
    <p>Make filling: Mix ricotta cheese and confectioners' sugar together in a large bowl<br>until well combined. Fold
        in
        chocolate and lemon zest.</p>
    <h3>Step 11</h3>
    <p>Transfer mixture into a pastry bag and pipe into shells, filling from the center to<br>one end, then doing the
        same
        from the other side. Dust with additional<br>confectioners' sugar to serve, if you like.</p>
